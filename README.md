# General
StatplayEngine.NET, at its most basic form, aims to be a C# / .NET port of https://github.com/Eebit/statplaying, the original ZEJ Statplay Engine project by Eebit, written in Java.

# Planned features
- pretty much everything.
- Module-based approach to adding any statistics-based roleplaying system to the Engine.
